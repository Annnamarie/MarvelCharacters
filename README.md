## Summary

MarvelHeroes is an android app that that takes in user query of marvel character displays a scrollable list of the search results of the character with an image, name, and description (if there is one) from the Marvel API

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: ðŸ˜„ðŸ§ ðŸ˜…

## Notes

This was a project to demonstrate RecyclerView. Here, RecyclerView was used to implement the scrollable view. I also learned a lot by exploring the Marvel API which needed a private key. 
This was quite a bit of a challenge and this week I was able to figure out how to make this work (I had been trying since last week, gave up, and switched to pokeAPI). 
I had to also add another manifest to clear the traffic for the specific URL. I had to do some research and happened to stumble upon this. I am still unsure why this allowed me to pull
up the images from the Marvel API but I will continue to research and explore as to why.
